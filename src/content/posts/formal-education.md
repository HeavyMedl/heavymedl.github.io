This page documents my path to earning a **B.Sc in Computer Science** from [The Evergreen State College](https://www.evergreen.edu/). It isn’t written for an audience or meant to be consumed by anyone but me; just a personal archive of what I studied during my undergraduate years and a way to preserve the details in one place.

I earned my **Bachelor of Science** on 14 June 2013, completing **186 undergraduate credits** in total. My studies began with **90 transfer credits** from South Puget Sound Community College (2005–2009), after which I completed the remainder of my coursework at Evergreen.

From 2011 to 2012, I completed **48 credits** in _Computer Science Foundations_, a full-year program covering Haskell, Java, computer architecture and organization, three sequences of discrete mathematics, and seminars in cognitive science, ethics, and robotics. In 2012–2013, I continued with **32 credits** in _Computability and Language Theory_, an advanced sequence focused on programming language design, interpreter construction, formal languages, logic, and two quarters of Haskell. I finished with **16 credits** in _Computing Practice and Theory_ during the spring of 2013, where I studied statistics, modeling, data mining, machine learning, and the role of computational methods in scientific research. The program concluded with an independent research and programming practicum.

## Computer Science Foundations

**Faculty:**

- **Neal Nelson, Ph.D.**
- **Sherri Shulman, Ph.D.**
- **Richard Weiss, Ph.D.**

Computer Science Foundations students engaged in intensive study of introductory/intermediate undergraduate computer science. Students were evaluated based on attendance, participation in program activities, written work (including computer programs and executable logic models), and performance on examinations. Students completed some or all of the various parts of the program described below.

### Introduction to Programming in Haskell

Introduction to Programming in Haskell covered the fundamental concepts and practice of computer programming and problem-solving using Haskell, a functional programming language. Haskell is very well suited for high-level problem-solving, and the problem-solving aspects of programming were emphasized. During the fall quarter students concentrated on how to write and debug Haskell programs and how to develop functional solutions to problems using primarily integers and lists. They studied how to construct programs from previously written components as well as how to read, understand, debug, and design programs. They also learned about recursion, types, and higher-order programming constructs such as maps, filters, list comprehensions, and folds. Students were evaluated based on eight programming assignments, seven laboratory assignments, a midterm exam, and a comprehensive final exam. The text for this portion of the program was _Programming in Haskell_ by Graham Hutton.

### Programming in Java I

Programming in Java I used the textbook _Big Java_, 4th edition by Cay Horstmann, and introduced students to programming in Java. Students learned:

- How to organize a solution using object-oriented design
- The fundamental data types, branches, loops, and arrays of Java
- Object-oriented polymorphism

Students were evaluated on eight programming assignments, a midterm, and a final. By the end of this class, students understood the basics of Java programming and simple uses of object-oriented programming and design.

### Programming in Java II

Programming in Java II continued with the textbook _Big Java_, 4th edition by Cay Horstmann. Students learned:

- How to use inheritance effectively
- The relationship of interfaces, abstract classes, and concrete classes
- Generic programming
- The use of recursion in an object-oriented language

Students were evaluated on eight programming assignments, a midterm, and a final. By the end of this class, students understood the basics of Java programming design, the use of classes, interfaces, and type parameters to support reusable implementations and design.

### Computer Organization

In Computer Organization the students studied the organization and logic of simple central processing units from the digital logic level to the instruction set architecture level. Topics included the representation of data in binary and hex, combinational logic, sequential logic, register transfer level data path architecture, and the instruction set level architecture. Students studied Chapters 1 to 10 of the textbook _Digital Computer Electronics_, third edition, by Albert Malvino and Gerald Brown, along with supplementary handout material. The class included weekly labs using a logic modeling program (Logisim) to build and simulate logic circuits. The lab work concluded with a complete logic model and simulation of a very simple Von Neumann-style computer. Students were evaluated on their attendance and participation in classroom learning activities, their weekly homework assignments, weekly labs, two examinations, and the final Computer Modeling Project.

### Computer Architecture I

Computer Architecture I extended the study of machine organization from the register-transfer level architecture to the instruction set architecture and assembly language level of abstraction using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) with the Jasmin JVM assembler. Students were first assigned simple assembly language programs with loops and decisions using a very simple 8-instruction accumulator-based Turing-complete machine. Studies then shifted to the architecture and assembly language programming of the Java Virtual Machine language, covering Chapters 1 to 5 and 10 of the textbook _Computer Organization and Assembly Language_, by Patrick Juola. Topics included JVM implementations of Java arrays, records, classes, objects and method calls as well as low-level assembly programming. There were two examinations, weekly textbook assignments, and eight hands-on JVM assembly language programming laboratory assignments.

### Computer Architecture II

Computer Architecture II continued the study of the Java Virtual Machine in the first half of the quarter with an emphasis on the implementation of the object-oriented features of Java, such as object creation, garbage collection, instance field access and update, method call and return, inheritance and polymorphism, and dynamic dispatch. The second half of the quarter covered key architectural concepts in systems and in support of high-level languages and operating systems: caching, interrupt handling, direct memory access, memory management, compiling, linking, loading, relocation, and virtual memory. Textbook material included Chapters 4–7 of _Principles of Computer Architecture_ by Miles Murdocca, and Chapter 1 of _Operating Systems_ by William Stallings. Students were assigned three programming lab exercises and weekly textbook exercises. There were two examinations.

### Discrete Mathematics I

In Discrete Mathematics I, students learned topics including propositional logic, predicate logic, Boolean algebra, methods of proof, elementary set theory, functions, summations, graph theory, induction, and recurrence relations. The text used was _Discrete Mathematics_, fifth edition by Dossey et al., covering chapters 2, 4, and 9. Students submitted weekly problem sets and took five quizzes and two exams.

### Discrete Mathematics II

In Discrete Mathematics II, students studied intermediate topics including trees, combinatorics, and number theory. The text used was _Discrete Mathematics_, fifth edition by Dossey et al., covering chapters 1, 3, 5, 8, and parts of 6. Students submitted seven problem sets and took four quizzes, a midterm, and a final exam.

### Discrete Mathematics III

In Discrete Mathematics III, students studied probability and statistics using R for five weeks and game theory for five weeks. Topics included binomial and multinomial distributions, normal distributions, probability densities, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing. Texts included _IPSUR_ by Jay Kerns and _Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability_ by Mosteller. Game theory content came from _Lessons in Play_ by Albert et al. Students completed six homework assignments, three quizzes, class participation, and two exams.

### Seminar: Explorations in the Cognitive Science of Mathematics and Computing

Students read _Where Mathematics Comes From_ (Lakoff & Núñez), _Arcadia_ (Tom Stoppard), and _Alone Together_ (Sherry Turkle). The seminar involved weekly two-hour discussions, two papers on metaphor and cognition, and weekly reflection posts.

### Seminar: Ethics and Technology

Students studied _Ethics and Technology_ by Herman Tavani, covering ethical frameworks, professional ethics, privacy, intellectual property, and issues in pervasive computing. Students wrote three papers analyzing contemporary ethical questions in technology.

### Seminar: Explorations in Robotics

Students read _The Robot_ by Lisa Nocks and several foundational robotics papers (Touretzky, Brooks), plus media such as _Radiolab: Talking to Machines_ and Errol Morris’s _Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control_. Hands-on lab work used Lego robots and the LeJOS library. Evaluation included participation, lab work, and written reports.
