title: A brief history of my formal education

This page documents my path to earning a **B.Sc in Computer Science** from [The Evergreen State College](https://www.evergreen.edu/). It isn’t written for an audience or meant to be consumed by anyone but me; just a personal archive of what I studied during my undergraduate years and a way to preserve the details in one place.

I earned my **Bachelor of Science** on 14 June 2013, completing **186 undergraduate credits** in total. My studies began with **90 transfer credits** from South Puget Sound Community College (2005–2009), after which I completed the remainder of my coursework at Evergreen.

From 2011 to 2012, I completed **48 credits** in _Computer Science Foundations_, a full-year program covering Haskell, Java, computer architecture and organization, three sequences of discrete mathematics, and seminars in cognitive science, ethics, and robotics. In 2012–2013, I continued with **32 credits** in _Computability and Language Theory_, an advanced sequence focused on programming language design, interpreter construction, formal languages, logic, and two quarters of Haskell. I finished with **16 credits** in _Computing Practice and Theory_ during the spring of 2013, where I studied statistics, modeling, data mining, machine learning, and the role of computational methods in scientific research. The program concluded with an independent research and programming practicum.

## Computer Science Foundations

**Faculty:**  
Neal Nelson, Ph.D.; Sherri Shulman, Ph.D.; Richard Weiss, Ph.D.

**Program Overview:**  
Computer Science Foundations students engaged in intensive study of introductory/intermediate undergraduate computer science. Students were evaluated based on attendance, participation, written work, programming assignments, logic-modeling labs, and examinations. The program included the following components:

**Introduction to Programming in Haskell:**  
Covered fundamental programming concepts and problem-solving using Haskell, including recursion, lists, higher-order functions, types, debugging, and functional design, based on _Programming in Haskell_ by Graham Hutton.

**Programming in Java I & II:**  
Used Horstmann’s _Big Java_ to teach object-oriented programming, data types, loops, arrays, polymorphism, inheritance, interfaces, abstract classes, generics, and recursion. Students completed eight programming assignments per quarter, plus midterm and final exams.

**Computer Organization:**  
Explored digital logic, data representation, combinational/sequential logic, CPU datapaths, instruction set architecture, and hands-on logic modeling using Logisim, culminating in a simulated Von Neumann computer.

**Computer Architecture I & II:**  
Focused on JVM architecture & assembly, object implementation, garbage collection, arrays, method calls, inheritance, dynamic dispatch, caching, interrupts, DMA, linking, loading, and virtual memory, using Juola, Murdocca, and Stallings texts.

**Discrete Mathematics I–III:**  
Covered logic, proofs, set theory, combinatorics, graph theory, number theory, probability, statistics (using R), and game theory.

**Seminars:**

- _Cognitive Science of Mathematics & Computing_: Lakoff & Núñez, Stoppard, Turkle, weekly discussions and reflection writing.
- _Ethics and Technology_: Tavani, papers on contemporary ethical questions.
- _Robotics_: Nocks, Brooks, hands-on Lego robotics labs with LeJOS.

## Computability and Language Theory

**Faculty:**  
Neal Nelson, Ph.D.; Sheryl Shulman, Ph.D.

**Program Overview:**  
An advanced program covering logic, programming language theory, interpreters, formal languages, and Haskell. Students completed up to four of five academic threads:

**Programming Language Design I & II:**  
Lexical analysis, parsing, type systems, semantics, interpretation, lambda calculus, type inference, and SCALA, based on Tucker & Noonan.

**Programming Language Project I & II:**  
Implementation of Clite and CliteF interpreters, including lexical analysis, parsing, static type checking, semantic evaluation, and functional extensions.

**Haskell I & II:**  
Covered higher-order functions, lazy evaluation, modules, algebraic & abstract data types, polymorphism, monads, functors, applicatives, and proofs.

**Formal Languages I & II:**  
Regular languages, grammars, finite automata, context-free grammars, pumping lemmas, pushdown automata, Turing machines, computability, and undecidability.

**Logic I & II:**  
Propositional & predicate logic, tableau proofs, completeness, clausal form, modal logic, constructive logic, paramodulation, and Prolog-based computation.

## Computing Practice and Theory

**Faculty:**  
Judith Bayard Cushing; Aaron A. Skomra; Richard S. Weiss

**Program Overview:**  
A project-oriented program integrating statistics, modeling, machine learning, and scientific computing, with an emphasis on eScience.

**Statistics, Modeling, and Data Analytics:**  
Covered distributions, ANOVA, regression, Chi-square, Monte Carlo/resampling, visualization using Excel, STELLA, JMP, and introductory R.

**Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Pattern Recognition:**  
Classification, clustering, regression, decision trees, rule sets, Weka experimentation, and implementation of k-means.

**Seminar: Computing Theory and Practice:**  
Explored the impact of computation on science through readings (Meadows, Salsburg, Lanier, Megler & Howe) and expert lectures on climate models, GPU computing, hydrologic modeling, graphics, and data systems.

**Student Project Practicum:**  
A self-directed research or programming project with weekly faculty-led affinity groups, written reports, oral presentations, and a final paper.
