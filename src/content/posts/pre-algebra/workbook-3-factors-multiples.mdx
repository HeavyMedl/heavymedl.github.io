    <p>Which number is divisible by $3$?</p>
  </div>

<div slot="hint">
  <p>
    Use the divisibility rule for $3$: add the digits of the number. If the sum of the digits is
    divisible by $3$, then the whole number is divisible by $3$.
  </p>
</div>

  <div slot="solution">
    <p>Use the divisibility rule for $3$: add the digits and see if the sum is divisible by $3$.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>$121: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$ (not divisible by $3$)</li>
      <li>$135: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9$ (divisible by $3$)</li>
      <li>$142: 1 + 4 + 2 = 7$ (not divisible by $3$)</li>
      <li>$208: 2 + 0 + 8 = 10$ (not divisible by $3$)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Only $135$ has a digit sum that is divisible by $3$.</p>
    <p>So the correct choice is <strong>B. 135</strong>.</p>

  <div slot="prompt">
    <p>What is the greatest common factor (GCF) of $16$ and $36$?</p>
  </div>

<div slot="hint">
  <p>
    Either list the factors of each number and find the largest one they share, or use prime
    factorization and take the common prime factors with the smallest exponents.
  </p>
</div>

  <div slot="solution">
    <p>Use prime factorization to find the GCF.</p>
    <p>
      $$
      16 = 2^4,\quad 36 = 2^2 \cdot 3^2
      $$
    </p>
    <p>The common prime factor is $2$, and the smallest power of $2$ that appears in both is $2^2 = 4$.</p>
    <p>So the GCF of $16$ and $36$ is $4$, and the correct choice is <strong>B. 4</strong>.</p>

    <p>What is the least common multiple (LCM) of $6$ and $15$?</p>
  </div>

<div slot="hint">
  <p>
    One way is to list multiples of each number until you find the smallest one they share. Another
    way is to use prime factorization and take all primes with the largest exponents from either
    number.
  </p>
</div>

  <div slot="solution">
    <p>Use prime factorization to find the LCM.</p>
    <p>
      $$
      6 = 2 \cdot 3,\quad 15 = 3 \cdot 5
      $$
    </p>
    <p>Include each prime factor with its largest exponent:</p>
    <p>
      $$
      \text{LCM} = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 30.
      $$
    </p>
    <p>So the correct choice is <strong>A. 30</strong>.</p>

    <p>How is the number $21$ classified?</p>

<div slot="hint">
  <p>
    A prime number has exactly two positive factors: $1$ and itself. A composite number has more
    than two positive factors. Check whether $21$ has any factors besides $1$ and $21$.

    <p>A prime number has exactly two positive factors: $1$ and itself.</p>
    <p>Check whether $21$ has any factors besides $1$ and $21$.</p>
    <p>
      $$
      21 = 3 \cdot 7
      $$
    </p>
    <p>So $21$ has factors $1, 3, 7,$ and $21$, which means it has more than two positive factors and is composite.</p>
    <p>The correct choice is <strong>B. Composite</strong>.</p>

  <p>
    Break $84$ down by dividing by small prime numbers ($2, 3, 5, 7,\dots$) until all factors are
    prime.

  <div slot="solution">
    <p>Use division by small primes to factor $84$.</p>
    <p>
      $$
      84 \div 2 = 42,\quad 42 \div 2 = 21,\quad 21 \div 3 = 7
      $$
    </p>
    <p>The remaining factor $7$ is prime, so</p>
    <p>
      $$
      84 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7.

    <p>So the correct choice is <strong>A. 2 · 2 · 3 · 7</strong>.</p>

    A number that is a multiple of both $5$ and $2$ must be divisible by $10$. Look for a number

    <p>A number that is a multiple of both $5$ and $2$ is divisible by $10$, so it ends in $0$.</p>

    List multiples of $8$ and $12$ until you find the smallest common one, or use prime
