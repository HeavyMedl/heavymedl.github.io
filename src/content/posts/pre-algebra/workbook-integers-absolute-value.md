This page is part of my pre-algebra practice workbook. Each problem is multiple choice and comes with a **Hint** (strategy only) and a full **Solution** so you can try it yourself before checking the answer.

## Problem 1

 Evaluate:

$$
-7 - 12
$$

- A. $-5$
- B. $5$
- C. $19$
- D. $-19$

**Hint**
  
Rewrite subtraction as “adding the opposite”:  
$$-7 - 12 = -7 + (-12).$$  
Then add the two negative numbers by adding their absolute values and keeping the negative sign.

**Solution**  

Rewrite:
$$
-7 - 12 = -7 + (-12).
$$

Add the absolute values:
$$
7 + 12 = 19.
$$

Since both numbers are negative, the result is negative:
$$
-7 + (-12) = -19.
$$

So the correct choice is **D.** $-19$.

## Problem 2

 Evaluate:

$$
15 + (-9)
$$

- A. $24$
- B. $-6$
- C. $-24$
- D. $6$

**Hint**

You’re adding a positive and a negative number. Compare their absolute values, subtract the smaller from the larger, and keep the sign of the number with the larger absolute value.

**Solution**  

Compute absolute values:
$$
|15| = 15, \quad |-9| = 9.
$$

Subtract:
$$
15 - 9 = 6.
$$

Since $15$ has the larger absolute value and is positive, the result is positive:
$$
15 + (-9) = 6.
$$

So the correct choice is **D.** $6$.

## Problem 3

 Evaluate:

$$
-4 \cdot 6
$$

- A. $24$
- B. $-24$
- C. $-10$
- D. $10$

**Hint**

Use the sign rule for multiplication:  
- Negative $\times$ positive = negative.  
Multiply the absolute values, then apply the correct sign.

**Solution**  

Compute absolute values:
$$
|{-4}| = 4, \quad |6| = 6.
$$

Multiply:
$$
4 \cdot 6 = 24.
$$

Since one factor is negative and the other is positive, the product is negative:
$$
-4 \cdot 6 = -24.
$$

So the correct choice is **B.** $-24$.

---

## Problem 4

 Evaluate:

$$
-48 \div (-6)
$$

- A. $-8$
- B. $-42$
- C. $8$
- D. $42$

**Hint**

Use the sign rule for division:  
- Negative $\div$ negative = positive.  
Then divide the absolute values.

**Solution**  

Absolute values:
$$
|{-48}| = 48, \quad |{-6}| = 6.
$$

Divide:
$$
48 \div 6 = 8.
$$

Negative divided by negative is positive:
$$
-48 \div (-6) = 8.
$$

So the correct choice is **C.** $8$.

---

## Problem 5

Evaluate:

$$
-2 - (-5) - 3
$$

- A. $0$
- B. $-10$
- C. $10$
- D. $4$

**Hint**

First rewrite subtraction as addition of the opposite, then work left to right:
$$
-2 - (-5) - 3 = -2 + 5 - 3.
$$

**Solution**  

Rewrite:
$$
-2 - (-5) - 3 = -2 + 5 - 3.
$$

Step 1:
$$
-2 + 5 = 3.
$$

Step 2:
$$
3 - 3 = 0.
$$

So:
$$
-2 - (-5) - 3 = 0.
$$

The correct choice is **A.** $0$.

---

## Problem 6

Evaluate:

$$
|-3| + |-7|
$$

- A. $4$
- B. $10$
- C. $-10$
- D. $14$

**Hint**

Use the definition of absolute value: it’s the distance from $0$, always nonnegative. Replace each absolute value with a positive number, then add.

**Solution**  

Compute:
$$
|-3| = 3, \quad |-7| = 7.
$$

Add:
$$
3 + 7 = 10.
$$

So the correct choice is **B.** $10$.

---

## Problem 7

 Evaluate:

$$
-\bigl|7 - 3 - 2\bigr| - |-5|
$$

- A. $-7$
- B. $7$
- C. $-3$
- D. $3$

**Hint**

First simplify inside each absolute value, then take the absolute value, then apply the outside signs. Finally combine the results.

**Solution**  

Inside the first absolute value:
$$
7 - 3 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2.
$$

Then:
$$
\bigl|7 - 3 - 2\bigr| = |2| = 2,
$$
so
$$
-\bigl|7 - 3 - 2\bigr| = -2.
$$

Second absolute value:
$$
|-5| = 5.
$$

Combine:
$$
-\bigl|7 - 3 - 2\bigr| - |-5| = -2 - 5 = -7.
$$

So the correct choice is **A.** $-7$.

---

## Problem 8

 Evaluate:

$$
|-5 - 8|
$$

- A. $-13$
- B. $3$
- C. $13$
- D. $-3$

**Hint**

First combine the integers inside the absolute value to get a single number, then take its absolute value.

**Solution**  

Inside:
$$
-5 - 8 = -13.
$$

Then:
$$
|-13| = 13.
$$

So the correct choice is **C.** $13$.

## Problem 9


The temperature at sunrise is $8^\circ\text{C}$.  
By midday, it drops by $15^\circ\text{C}$, and by evening it rises by $4^\circ\text{C}$.  

What is the temperature in the evening?

- A. $-3^\circ\text{C}$
- B. $3^\circ\text{C}$
- C. $11^\circ\text{C}$
- D. $-11^\circ\text{C}$

**Hint**

Represent each change as adding an integer: a drop is adding a negative number, a rise is adding a positive number. Start from $8$ and apply the changes:  
$$
8 + (\text{change}_1) + (\text{change}_2).
$$

**Solution**  

Drop of $15^\circ\text{C}$: add $-15$  
Rise of $4^\circ\text{C}$: add $+4$

Expression:
$$
8 + (-15) + 4.
$$

Compute:
$$
8 + (-15) = -7,
$$
then
$$
-7 + 4 = -3.
$$

So the evening temperature is
$$
-3^\circ\text{C}.
$$

The correct choice is **A.** $-3^\circ\text{C}$.

## Problem 10


A bank account starts with a balance of $120$.

- A withdrawal of $75$ is made.  
- Then a deposit of $40$ is made.  
- Finally, another withdrawal of $25$ is made.  

What is the final balance?

- A. $20$
- B. $40$
- C. $60$
- D. $80$

**Hint**

Write each transaction as an integer (withdrawal = negative, deposit = positive) and add them with the starting balance:
$$
120 + (\text{change}_1) + (\text{change}_2) + (\text{change}_3).
$$

**Solution**  

Transactions as integers:

- Starting balance: $120$  
- Withdrawal of $75$: $-75$  
- Deposit of $40$: $+40$  
- Withdrawal of $25$: $-25$

Expression:
$$
120 - 75 + 40 - 25.
$$

Compute step by step:
$$
120 - 75 = 45,
$$
$$
45 + 40 = 85,
$$
$$
85 - 25 = 60.
$$

So the final balance is
$$
60.
$$

The correct choice is **C.** $60$.
