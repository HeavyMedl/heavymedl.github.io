## Skills

**Languages:** Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML / CSS, Java, Haskell

**Tools and Frameworks:** Node.js, Git, Ubuntu, Docker, Spring, Vue, Vite, Webpack, React, Astro, $\LaTeX$

## Industry Achievements

Here are a few accomplishments that I am proud of. See more <a href="https://heavymedl.dev/cv/#industry-achievements" target="_blank">here</a>.

- **I introduced Vite, Vitest, and Vue 3 to REI.**: I developed a technology proof that replaced our tools with Vite and Vitest. Additionally, I updated our back-end library to integrate Vite-compiled assets and rewrote our server-rendering solution for Vue to support Vue 3. All product engineering teams at REI adopted this solution. Read the whole story [here](https://heavymedl.dev/posts/unleashing-the-power-of-vite-and-vitest-at-rei/).
- **I rewrote REI's Adventures property using Vue.**: When I joined REI, my team and I rewrote REI's Adventures property using Vue. We decommissioned several overlapping frameworks, ported functional requirements from legacy code, and delivered new user journeys.
- **I developed middleware to enable server-side rendering for Vue applications at REI**: I created an Express.js application using TypeScript that handles server-side rendering for Vue applications within REI's technology stack. This Dockerized server operates alongside the central microsite, processing HTTP requests to generate server bundles. It then sends the final HTML back to the central microsite, which integrates into our base templates.
