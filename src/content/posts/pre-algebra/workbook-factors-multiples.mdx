    <p>Which number is divisible by $3$?</p>
  </div>

  <div slot="hint">
    <p>
      Use the divisibility rule for $3$: add the digits of the number.  
      If the sum of the digits is divisible by $3$, then the whole number is divisible by $3$.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div slot="solution">
    <p>Check each option by summing its digits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>$121: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$ (not divisible by $3$)</li>
      <li>$135: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9$ (divisible by $3$)</li>
      <li>$142: 1 + 4 + 2 = 7$ (not divisible by $3$)</li>
      <li>$208: 2 + 0 + 8 = 10$ (not divisible by $3$)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Only $135$ has a digit sum divisible by $3$.

    <p>What is the greatest common factor (GCF) of $16$ and $36$?</p>
  </div>

  <div slot="hint">
    <p>
      Either list the factors of each number and find the largest one they share,
      or use prime factorization and take the common prime factors with the smallest exponents.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div slot="solution">
    <p>Using prime factorization:</p>
    <p>
      $16 = 2^4$  
      $36 = 2^2 \cdot 3^2$
    </p>
    <p>
      The common prime factor is $2$, and the smallest power of $2$ that appears in both
      is $2^2 = 4$.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the GCF of $16$ and $36$ is $4$.

    <p>What is the least common multiple (LCM) of $6$ and $15$?</p>
  </div>

  <div slot="hint">
    <p>
      One way is to list multiples of each number until you find the smallest one they share.  
      Another way is to use prime factorization and take all primes with the largest exponents from either number.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div slot="solution">
    <p>Using prime factorization:</p>
    <p>
      $6 = 2 \cdot 3$  
      $15 = 3 \cdot 5$
    </p>
    <p>
      Include each prime factor with its largest exponent:
      $2$, $3$, and $5$.
    </p>
    <p>
      So
      $$
      \text{LCM} = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 30.

    <p>How is the number $21$ classified?</p>
  </div>

  <div slot="hint">
    <p>
      A prime number has exactly two positive factors: $1$ and itself.  
      A composite number has more than two positive factors.  
      Check whether $21$ has any factors besides $1$ and $21$.
    </p>

  <div slot="solution">
    <p>
      Check small divisors:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>$21 \div 2$ is not an integer.</li>
      <li>$21 \div 3 = 7$ (an integer), so $3$ is a factor.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Since $21$ has factors $1, 3, 7,$ and $21$, it has more than two positive factors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, $21$ is <strong>composite</strong>.

      Break $84$ down by dividing by small prime numbers ($2, 3, 5, 7,\dots$) until all factors are prime.

    <p>Factor step by step:</p>
    <p>
      $84 \div 2 = 42$  
      $42 \div 2 = 21$  
      $21 \div 3 = 7$  
      $7$ is prime.

      So
      $$
      84 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7.

  <div slot="hint">

      A number that is a multiple of both $5$ and $2$ must be divisible by $10$.  
      Look for a number that ends in $0$.

  <div slot="solution">
    <p>Check the last digit of each number:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>$18$ ends in $8$ (not a multiple of $5$).</li>

      <li>$32$ ends in $2$ (multiple of $2$ but not $5$).</li>
      <li>$40$ ends in $0$ (multiple of both $5$ and $2$).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      So $40$ is a multiple of both $5$ and $2$.

      List multiples of $8$ and $12$ until you find the smallest common one,

  <div slot="solution">

    <p>
      $8 = 2^3$  
      $12 = 2^2 \cdot 3$

    <p>
      Take each prime with the largest exponent:
      $2^3$ and $3^1$.

      $18 = 2 \cdot 3^2$  
      $24 = 2^3 \cdot 3$  
      $30 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5$
    </p>
    <p>
      Common prime factors: $2$ and $3$.

    <p>
      The smallest exponent for $2$ among them is $2^1$, and for $3$ is $3^1$.
