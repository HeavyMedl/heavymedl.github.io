    <p>What is the <strong>best</strong> classification for the number</p>
    <p>
      $$
      12
      $$
    </p>
  </div>

<div slot="hint">
  <p>
    Think about which sets 12 belongs to: it is positive, has no fractional part, and is not zero.
    Start with the most specific set (like the counting numbers) and move outward to larger sets.
  </p>
</div>

  <div slot="solution">
    <p>The number $12$ is a positive whole number with no fractional part.</p>
    <p>
      That means it is a <strong>natural number</strong>. Because natural numbers are also whole numbers,
      integers, rational numbers, and real numbers, $12$ belongs to all of those sets.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we are asked for the <strong>best</strong> classification, we choose the most specific set it belongs to,
      which is the set of <strong>natural numbers</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the correct choice is <strong>A. Natural number</strong>.

      $$
      0
      $$
    </p>
  </div>

<div slot="hint">
  <p>
    Ask: Is $0$ a counting number? Is it included when we start counting $1,2,3,\dots$? Then think
    about which set is the smallest one that still includes $0$.
  </p>
</div>

  <div slot="solution">
    <p>
      The number $0$ is not one of the counting numbers $1,2,3,\dots$, so it is not usually classified as natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, $0$ <strong>is</strong> a <strong>whole number</strong>, and therefore also an integer,
      a rational number, and a real number.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smallest set that contains $0$ is the set of <strong>whole numbers</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the correct choice is <strong>B. Whole number</strong>.
    </p>

    </p>
  </div>

<div slot="hint">
  <p>
    Negative numbers are not natural or whole. Think about which set is the smallest one that
    includes all negative whole numbers.
  </p>
</div>

  <div slot="solution">
    <p>The number $-7$ is negative, so it cannot be a natural number or a whole number.</p>
    <p>
      It is a <strong>negative whole number</strong>, which means it is an <strong>integer</strong>.
      All integers are also rational and real, but integer is the most specific set here.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the correct choice is <strong>C. Integer</strong>.

      \frac{3}{4}
      $$
    </p>
  </div>

<div slot="hint">
  <p>
    Ask: Is $\frac{3}
    {4}$ a whole number or integer? Remember that rational numbers are fractions of integers with a
    nonzero denominator.
  </p>
</div>

  <div slot="solution">
    <p>The number $\frac{3}{4}$ is not a whole number or an integer because it is not a whole value.</p>
    <p>
      It can be written as a ratio of integers:
    </p>
    <p>
      $$
      \frac{3}{4}
      $$
    </p>
    <p>
      so it is a <strong>rational number</strong>. All rational numbers are also real numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most specific set it belongs to is the set of <strong>rational numbers</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the correct choice is <strong>D. Rational number</strong>.

      $$
      -2.5
      $$
    </p>
  </div>

<div slot="hint">
  <p>
    Check whether $-2.5$ can be written as a fraction of integers. If it can, it is rational. Then
    ask which set is the smallest one that includes it.
  </p>
</div>

  <div slot="solution">
    <p>The number $-2.5$ has a decimal part, so it is not natural, whole, or an integer.</p>
    <p>
      We can rewrite it as a fraction of integers:
    </p>
    <p>
      $$
      -2.5 = -\frac{5}{2}.
      $$
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a ratio of integers, so $-2.5$ is a <strong>rational number</strong> (and also a real number).
    </p>
    <p>
      The most specific set it belongs to is the set of <strong>rational numbers</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the correct choice is <strong>D. Rational number</strong>.

    <p>Which of the following numbers is <strong>not</strong> an integer?</p>
  </div>

<div slot="hint">
  <p>
    Integers are all the whole numbers and their negatives: $\dots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\dots$. Look for
    the number that has a fractional or decimal part.

</div>

  <div slot="solution">
    <p>
      Integers are all the whole numbers and their negatives:
    </p>
    <p>
      $$
      \dots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\dots
      $$
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the choices, $3$, $-4$, and $0$ are all integers. The number $2.7$ has a decimal part,
      so it is <strong>not</strong> an integer.

    <p>
      So the correct choice is <strong>D. 2.7</strong>.

      Which number is a <strong>natural number</strong> that is also <strong>even</strong>?
    </p>

<div slot="hint">
  <p>
    Natural numbers are the counting numbers $1,2,3,\dots$. Even numbers are divisible by $2$ with
    no remainder. Look for a positive counting number that is even.
  </p>

  <div slot="solution">
    <p>
      Natural numbers are the counting numbers $1,2,3,\dots$, and an even number is divisible by $2$.
    </p>
    <p>Check each option:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>$0$ is even, but it is not usually counted as a natural number.</li>
      <li>$-6$ is even, but it is negative, so it is not natural.</li>
      <li>$7$ is natural, but it is odd.</li>
      <li>$14$ is a positive counting number and divisible by $2$, so it is even and natural.</li>
    </ul>

      A teacher counts the number of students present in class.  
      The number of students is best classified as which kind of number?

<div slot="hint">
  <p>
    Think about how we count people: $1$ student, $2$ students, etc. We never have $2.5$ students.
    Which set describes positive counting quantities?
  </p>
</div>

  <div slot="solution">
    <p>
      The number of students present must be a positive whole number: $1,2,3,\dots$.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are <strong>natural numbers</strong>. Natural numbers are also whole, integer, rational,
      and real, but natural number is the most specific classification here.

      Which is the <strong>best</strong> classification for this quantity?
    </p>
  </div>

<div slot="hint">
  <p>
    Bank balances can include decimals (like $\$45.75$) and can also be negative. Think about which
    set includes fractions and decimals made from integers.
  </p>
</div>

  <div slot="solution">
    <p>
      A bank balance can be positive or negative and may include cents (decimals),
      such as $\$45.75$.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any exact decimal with a finite number of decimal places can be written as a fraction of integers,
      so it is a <strong>rational number</strong>. All rational numbers are also real.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best classification for a bank balance is therefore <strong>rational number</strong>.

    <p>

    <p>Which of the following numbers is <strong>irrational</strong>?</p>

<div slot="hint">
  <p>
    Rational numbers can be written as a fraction of integers with a nonzero denominator. Look for
    the number that <strong>cannot</strong> be written as a fraction of integers.

  <div slot="solution">
    <p>Check each choice:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        $\frac{4}{9}$ is a fraction of integers, so it is rational.
      </li>
      <li>
        $-3$ can be written as $\frac{-3}{1}$, so it is rational.
      </li>
      <li>
        $0.75$ can be written as $\frac{75}{100} = \frac{3}{4}$, so it is rational.
      </li>
      <li>
        $\sqrt{2}$ cannot be written as a fraction of integers; it is a classic example of an
        <strong>irrational</strong> number.
